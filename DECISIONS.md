# Build Decisions

Places where the spec (`MEDBRIDGE_DEV_SPEC.md`) was unclear, silent, or needed a concrete choice. Each entry picks the simplest option that respects the hard rules.

## D1. The repository root is the project root
§5 shows a top-level `medbridge/` folder. The git repo already exists at this folder, so `backend/` and `frontend/` sit directly in the repo root. No extra `medbridge/` wrapper.

## D2. Python 3.12 for the backend venv
The spec asks for Python 3.11+. The machine has 3.11, 3.12 and 3.14. 3.12 is used because PyTorch, FAISS and PyMuPDF all ship stable wheels for it. 3.14 is too new for some of these.

## D3. CPU-only PyTorch
`sentence-transformers` needs PyTorch. The CPU-only wheel (`--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`) is installed before the other requirements, as §16.2 suggests. It is much smaller than the CUDA build, and a GPU is not needed for a small knowledge base.

## D4. Task list kept in `TASKS.md`
No task-tracking tool was available while building, so progress is tracked in `TASKS.md` at the repo root.

## D5. Frontend scaffolded by hand, not with `npm create vite`
`npm create vite` asks questions interactively. The same files (package.json, vite.config.js, index.html, src/) are written directly, using the same React + Vite template layout.

## D6. Live Groq checks deferred
The user will add the Groq API key to `backend/.env` later and asked for light testing only. The live acceptance checks (real Groq calls in Phases 2 and 4) are skipped during the build. Every LLM code path is covered by the mocked tests instead. `backend/.env` was created from `.env.example` with the placeholder key. Until a real key is added, the server refuses to start and says so clearly (fail-fast, §13).

## D7. Qualitative results that match the expected result count as "normal"
§13 says rows that can't be parsed get status `unknown`. A row such as "Urine Glucose: Negative (reference: Negative)" is a clear, deterministic match, so it is marked `normal` with `status_source: computed`. Any other text-only result without a lab flag stays `unknown`.

## D8. "Borderline" comes only from the lab's own flag
The spec allows `borderline` when the lab prints it or for labelled bands. For simplicity, only the lab's printed flag (e.g. "Borderline High") produces `borderline`. For labelled bands such as "Desirable: <200 Borderline: 200-239", the first (desirable) band is used as the range (§8.4).

## D9. At least 4 doctor questions
If the explanation call returns fewer than 4 doctor questions, generic, safe questions are added so the Phase 2 target (≥ 4 questions) always holds.

## D10. FAISS with an exact numpy fallback
On the build machine, Windows Application Control (Smart App Control) blocked FAISS's native DLL (`DLL load failed ... An Application Control policy has blocked this file`). PyTorch and the embedding model load fine. The index store therefore uses FAISS `IndexFlatIP` when its library loads, and otherwise does the same exact inner-product search with a numpy matrix product. Vectors are always saved to `vectors.npy` alongside `faiss.index`, so one index works with either backend. For a few hundred normalised vectors the results are identical. `faiss-cpu` stays in `requirements.txt`.

## D11. Knowledge-base reference URLs
Every KB document is written in plain language in the project's own words. Each file's frontmatter credits the public reference it was checked against: mostly MedlinePlus, plus NHS, Testing.com and Cleveland Clinic. No text was copied. Please open each `source_url` once before the demo, because health websites sometimes move pages.

## D12. Retrieval threshold kept at 0.35
`scripts/eval_retrieval.py` showed on-topic top scores of 0.51–0.76 and off-topic scores of 0.04–0.14. The default `RAG_MIN_SCORE=0.35` sits well inside that gap, so it was not changed. Results: hit@1 = 0.95, hit@3 = 1.00 on 20 questions (`backend/scripts/eval_results.md`).

## D13. `used_report_context` is true only if the answer used the report
The response flag is set when report context was sent **and** the answer contains a `[Report]` marker. This is the most honest signal for the UI.

## D14. The prebuilt index is not committed
`backend/data/index/` stays git-ignored. Build it with `python -m scripts.build_index` (about 30 seconds after the model download). This way the index can never get out of date with the knowledge base.

## D15. One live test stands in for the deferred live checks
`backend/tests/test_live.py` (marked `live`, skipped by default) runs the Phase 2 acceptance check against the real Groq API: the CBC sample must return Haemoglobin `low`, at least 4 doctor questions and a disclaimer, in under 15 s. Once a key is in `.env`, run `pytest -m live`. In that mode `conftest.py` keeps the real key instead of the dummy test key.

## D16. Screenshots (resolved)
Once the Groq key was set, screenshots of live output on the synthetic samples were added to `docs/screenshots/` and the README.

## D17. Rate limiting is middleware
The optional per-IP limit from §12 (20 requests per minute) is Starlette middleware, not a route, so the two-endpoint rule still holds. Set `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=0` to turn it off.

## D18. Default model changed to `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
On 2026-11-12, Groq returned `404 model_not_found` for `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (the spec's default; §0 warns that Groq retires models). From the models this key can use, `openai/gpt-oss-120b` was chosen: a large general chat model with JSON mode and a 131k context. The live CBC check passes in about 9 s. The model is still read only from `GROQ_MODEL`, so it can be changed in `.env` without touching code.

## D19. Full-width citation brackets are normalised
gpt-oss sometimes writes markers as `【1】` / `【Report】`. `answerer.normalize_markers` converts them to `[1]` / `[Report]` before citations are mapped, so source mapping, the "your report" badge and `used_report_context` work for any model.

## D20. New features added without new endpoints
Requested features: sample picker, donut summary, detail drawer, glossary tooltips, Hindi. Each one fits inside the two existing endpoints or runs entirely in the browser:
- **Detail drawer ("related knowledge")**: `/api/analyze-report` now attaches, to each test, the matching knowledge-base passages ("What it measures" plus the section for its direction, e.g. "What low values can be associated with") and the doc's "Questions you might ask your doctor" bullets. This is **retrieval only, no LLM call** (`services/rag/related.py`). With no index loaded it is skipped and analysis still works (§8.1).
- **Hindi**: `/api/analyze-report` accepts an optional `language` form field (`en` default, `hi`). For Hindi, one extra rule is appended to the explanation system prompt. The §9 prompt text is unchanged and is sent exactly as written for English. Extraction, status computation and test names stay in English.
- **Caching**: each language's result is cached **in the browser's memory only** (React state), so switching back and forth calls the AI once per language. A server-side cache would mean keeping report data on the server, which breaks the no-persistence rule (§0.3).
- **Glossary, donut, sample picker, read-aloud, visit-summary download, dashboard ordering**: frontend only.

## D21. Additive schema extensions
§7.3 says to implement the models exactly. All original fields are unchanged. Two optional, backward-compatible fields were added and are marked `[Extension]` in `schemas.py`:
- `LabTest.related` (`RelatedKnowledge`: `passages: list[Source]`, `doctor_questions: list[str]`)
- `AnalyzeReportResponse.language` (`"en" | "hi"`)

`Source` was moved above `LabTest` so it can be reused; its fields are unchanged.

## D22. Glossary written in-house
The 61 glossary definitions (`frontend/src/utils/glossary.js`) are short, plain-language explanations written for the project and consistent with the knowledge base. Tooltips highlight only the first mention of each term in a block, so text stays readable. Single letters and everyday words are excluded.

## D23. Extra features chosen by the build agent
- **Listen** (Web Speech API) reads the summary aloud in English or Hindi. This helps persona P3 (a caregiver for an elderly relative). The button is hidden in browsers without speech support.
- **Download summary**: a plain-text doctor-visit note (summary, results out of range first, questions, disclaimer). It is generated in the browser and nothing is sent anywhere. This is the lightweight version of the "printable doctor visit summary" listed in §19.
- **Add questions from the drawer** to the report's doctor-question list.
- **"Only terms in my report"** filter in the glossary.
